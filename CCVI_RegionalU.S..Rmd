##### Introduction
* Over the past few months I have come across a lot of interesting information and 
resources relating to the current pandemic. One of the things I have noticed in particular is the amount
of publicly accessible data relating to COVID-19.

* An interesting dataset I chose to work on was the [Surgo Foundation's COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI)][1]. The CCVI is a resource that helps to identify areas in the U.S. where support is most needed. As they put it, 
  "The CCVI is not designed to predict which individuals will become infected with coronavirus â€“ instead, it tells us about the anticipated negative impact at the community level." 
  
##### CCVI Data
* The data is organized by state and county (as well as census tract data), and I decided to summarize the state data at the regional level. I used the regions West, Southwest, Midwest, Southeast, and Northeast to group the states as defined by numerous sources including [National Geographic][2].

* The overall CCVI is a composite of six themes / vulnerability indicators. Below you can see an interactive plot that allows you to view the vulnerability scores for each indicator across U.S. regions, with a higher score meaning higher vulnerability in case there were states with parituclalry high or low vulnerability that may stand out from the region and influence the average. 


```{r eruptions, echo=FALSE}
inputPanel(
 selectInput(inputId = "variable", label = "Indicator:", 
                    choices = 
                      c("Overall CCVI Score" = "ccvi_score",
                        "Socioeconomic Status" = "theme_1",
                        "Household Composition & Disability" = "theme_2",
                        "Minority Status & Language" = "theme_3",
                        "Housing Type & Transportation" = "theme_4",
                        "Epidemiologic Factors" = "theme_5",
                        "Healthcare System Factors" = "theme_6"), multiple = FALSE),
        
        helpText("View the overall scores, or choose from the six themes / indicators that were used to calculate the Overall CCVI Score.", 
                 "A higher score indicates higher vulnerability.")
)

renderPlot({
  # plot ccvi mean / median side-by-side
      ggplot(data = rg_data, aes(x = region, y = unlist(rg_data[,input$variable]), fill = value)) + 
        geom_col(position = position_dodge(), color = 'black', lwd = 0.8) + 
        scale_fill_brewer(palette="Greens") +
        geom_text(aes(label=unlist(rg_data[,input$variable])), position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),
                  vjust=-0.5, size=4) +
        theme_minimal() +
        ylab('Scores') +
        xlab('U.S. Region') +
        ggtitle('Mean / Median Scores across U.S. Regions')
})
```


##### Results
* The results show evidence that communities in the Southeast and Southwest have the highest overall vulnerability, and suggests that those are the regions where more support / resources should be allocated. 

##### Conclusion
* Based on the indicator descriptions given on the Surgo Foundation's [website][1], and evaluating the different indicator scores, it appears these regions were vulnerable due to a variety of factors such as lower income, higher unemployment, larger elderly population, racial marginalization, and other underlying health conditions. It is also notable that the Northeast has the lowest overall score despite New York being called the [epicenter of the pandemic][3] at one point.
