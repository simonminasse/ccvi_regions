# Project Plan
# Organize CCVI state data into regions as defined by National Geographic
# Create RShiny App that provides a bar chart of CCVI SCORE by Region
# The RShiny App should also provide bar charts for each of the 6 themes
# For each theme, the bar charts are based on median and average scores for the region
